Switch is a planning model for power systems with large shares of renewable energy that incorporates a condensed form of production cost modeling into capacity planning problems. The Switch Energy Planning model was originally written by Matthias Fripp as part of his dissertation at the University of California Berkeley in 2008. After Matthias graduated, he provided a copy to the the Renewable and Appropriate Energy Laboratory at UC Berkeley to advance the work. Researchers at RAEL forked his codebase, writing new features and extending it to various regional studies. 

In 2012, Matthias published a public repository of Switch at https://sourceforge.net/projects/switch-model, releasing it under GPL v3. Subsequently, RAEL publicly released their fork under the same GPL license.
